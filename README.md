# 🎾 Canvas Bouncing Ball Animation

A beginner-friendly project built using **HTML5 Canvas API**, demonstrating how to create a smooth and interactive 2D animation of a ball bouncing within a confined space. This project is part of my exploration of creative coding and front-end fundamentals.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project simulates a **green ball** moving across a **blue canvas**. It bounces off the edges of the canvas, simulating basic collision detection and animation principles. The animation is achieved using the native HTML5 `Canvas API` and `requestAnimationFrame()` for smooth rendering.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand how to set up and use the HTML `<canvas>` element
- Apply 2D graphics using the CanvasRenderingContext2D
- Implement basic game physics like collision detection and direction reversal
- Separate structure (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JavaScript)

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
canvas-bouncing-ball/
├── index.html         # Contains the HTML structure and canvas element
├── style.css          # Styles the canvas and page layout
├── script.js          # JavaScript logic for the ball's motion and bouncing
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## 💻 How to Run This Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/canvas-bouncing-ball.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the folder:**
   ```bash
   cd canvas-bouncing-ball
   ```

3. **Open `index.html`** in your preferred web browser.

> No build tools or servers needed — this is a pure HTML/CSS/JS static project.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By building this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Creating real-time animations using `requestAnimationFrame()`
- Handling object movement and boundary collision
- Working with canvas drawing methods (`fillRect`, `arc`, `fillStyle`, etc.)
- Structuring small projects using separate HTML, CSS, and JS files

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

Here are a few ways to take this project further:
- [ ] Add keyboard or mouse control to move the ball
- [ ] Make the ball change color or speed on collision
- [ ] Add multiple balls with independent motion and collision
- [ ] Show FPS (frames per second) counter for performance
- [ ] Add sound effects on bounce
- [ ] Use gradients or images for the background
